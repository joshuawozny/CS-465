### Architecture
<p>We used Express and Angular frameworks for different portions of our website.Angular is a front-end framework primarily used for building Single Page Applications (SPAs). It provides a structured way to create dynamic web applications with features like data binding, routing, and dependency injection.Express is primarily a backend framework used for building web applications and APIs. It handles HTTP requests, routing, middleware, and interfacing with databases or other services. While Express can serve HTML files and handle server-side rendering, it's not focused on front-end development like Angular.</p>

* Angular is a front-end framework for building Single Page Applications (SPAs), while
Express is a back-end framework for building server-side applications, including
RESTful APIs.
* Angular provides rich client-side functionality with features like data binding,
dependency injection, routing, and component-based architecture, leading to a more
interactive and dynamic user experience.
* Express mainly focuses on handling HTTP requests, routing, middleware management,
and interfacing with databases or other services. It serves as the backend API for Angular
or other front-end frameworks.
* SPAs built with Angular offer seamless user interactions without page reloads, providing
a smoother and more responsive user experience compared to traditional web
applications.
* We used MongoDB, a NoSQL database, which means it doesn't require a predefined schema like traditional relational databases. This flexibility allows you to store different types of data in the same collection without a rigid structure. It's particularly useful for applications with evolving or unpredictable data requirements.

### Functionality
<p> JSON acts as a bridge between frontend and backend development by providing a standardized format for exchanging data, enabling seamless communication and integration between different parts of a web application.JSON facilitates the integration of frontend and backend components by providing a common data format that can be easily parsed and manipulated by both sides.</p>
<o>JavaScript is a programming language commonly used in web development for adding interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages.
JavaScript objects are collections of key-value pairs where keys are strings and values can be of any data type, including other objects or functions.
JavaScript allows for the creation, manipulation, and interaction with JSON data through built-in methods like JSON.parse() and JSON.stringify()</o>
<p>Creating reusable modules is at the heart of the developing within MEAN stack. Code is refactored throughout the process as Services and Components are added to the project. If code is being duplicated in separate parts of a module, then it is likely that some refactoring is needed.</p>

### Testing

<p>Within our development project, we generally used integration testing by directly interacting with the web site. To test the API Seoarately, we used Postman to test each API endpoint.</p>

### Reflection

<p>This course was interesting and engaging,  I learned more about debugging code, and researching various errors that occured. Overall, the project was frustrating as most of the sample code didn't work in my environment due to version differences between packages.</p>

## Course Description

Students will design and develop a full stack application through the utilization of programming language frameworks. In creating a full stack application, students will also be responsible for developing a database as well as the code that interfaces their application to the database. This course is the first course in a two-course sequence.
