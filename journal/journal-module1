Iterative Full Stack Development with the MEAN stack: An Introduction

    What were the most challenging aspects of the installation process for you?
	Full stack development with the MEAN stack requires the installation of several 
	applications and utilities:
	
    	1) Install Node.js and Node Package Manager (NPM) by following the instructions.
    	2) Download the Git distributed version control system by following the instructions.
    	3) Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code) by following the instructions.
	   Please note: This is the free, lightweight source editor. This is not the full Visual Studio package.
    	4) Install the MongoDB Community Server by following the instructions.
    	5) Download the Robo 3T graphical IDE for MongoDB by following the instructions.

	Overall, the instructions were clear and straightforward. Since I'm running Ubuntu Linux 22.04, I made 
	sure I checked any special instructions provided in the Ubuntu package manager.

    How would you gauge your level of experience with HTML and JavaScript after the tutorial?
	HTML and Javascript skills are useful to create any full stack application using the MEAN stack. The Express
	framework handles alot of the behind the scenes routing and page handling, but HTML and Javascript are needed
	to provide the appropriate content on each page or partial page.

    How would you sum up Module One?
	Module One describes the steps necessary to install the applications to use the MEAN stack to create full
	stack applications. It walks the class through creating a new Express application and set up routes and partial
	pages to store common elements on a page. It also introduces best practices associated with git versioning. 
	It explains why branching of new code is important and describes how this is accomplished.
